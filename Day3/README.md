# Logic Optimisation

Squeezing Design to a optimised design for area and power savings
- Boolean-Logic Optimisation : using K-Map, QM Method
- Constant Propagation: a direct optimisation

## 1. Combinational Logic Optimisation

A compiler optimization technique that involves the reduction of variables with constants during synthesis.
- Reduces Gate count
- It improves timing paths and optimizes resources
- Reduces power as a result

## 2. Sequential Logic Optimisation

- State Optimisation
- Retiming
- Sequential Logic Cloning
